# Bamazon - Node.js & MySQL

## Overview
This app is an Amazon-like storefront using Node.js & MySQL at the command line that takes in an order from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory after the order has been processed. 
1. Bamazon.js code is here: https://github.com/smcelfresh/bamazon/blob/master/bamazonCustomer.js
  * Prints all the products from the stores database table.
  * You then select and enter an item you would like to order from the printed list.
  * Then, enter the quantity you need at the prompt.
  * The app will return your entered values and tell you your total cost before updating the database quantity.
